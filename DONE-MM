Things that were on my TODO list and have been accomplished
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Oct. 2002 {for "banner"; silhouette was earlier}:

 1) Silhouette und Banner Plot :
	Label vertical axis of horizontal barplot using HORIZONTAL text
	{i.e., par(las = 1) or axis(*, las = 1)}
    --> Should become an optional (but probably default)
	feature of barplot()!


July 2002:

  clara():  Must have allocation(?) bug in Fortran --> ../cluster_tests/clara.R

	    --- bug (not allocation!) found and eliminated.

  o all [ agnes, clara, daisy, diana, fanny, pam ] now have something like

        valmisdat <- min(x2, na.rm=TRUE) - 0.5 #(double) VALue for MISsing DATa

    but this will go wrong as soon as  min(x2) < -5e15  !!!

   --> now using something more sensible


May 2002:

  data/flower.R :  Big problem: V1..V3 should be binary, i.e. 0:1
  man/flower.Rd :  but as factors they become  1:2 !
		==> the example (.. type = list(asymm = 1)
		has probably been wrong all the time -- compare to JSS  paper!
  --- no!  the changes to cluster-1.5.1 which test these,etc
      give no difference!

o clusplot() -- drawing MVE ellipses (-> .Fortran("spannel",..)) :
	     S-plus has ellipses that just exactly contain all points.
	     whereas our ellipses are *always* slightly too large.

o Provide a user function
     ellipsoidhull <- function(x, n = 201)
     = a combination of internal .Fortran("spannel",.), cov.wt() & ellipse()


o man/flower.Rd :  use \describe{  \item ... for the 8 variables

* OLDER

  2) help files for plot.*()
	 --- new arguments are in *.Rd,
	 but not really documented.

  5) a more thorough test of .Fortran("spannel", *) used in clusplot(*).

     -> done {new ellipsoidhull() }

-------------

./R/daisy.q  :

  Now that daisy objects inherit from "dist",  we can use  as.matrix() and
  other dist methods which can be *very* useful !
  --> also upgraded ./man/dissimilarity.object.Rd

  {remaining:  improve our code or the examples ?!}

 8) Make bannerplot() an (possibly later namespace internal ?)
    standalone function called from both  plot.agnes() and plot.diana(),
    even plot.mona()!
